Code for the self reinformcement learning competition at blackboxchallenge.com

This is a pretty straight forward submission for the black box challenge. If there is structure in the data it should find it eventually.

It uses a 100 neuron neural network
Has one value for a number of learning epochs with a high (but decreasing) exploration rate
One value for of learning epochs
Stores neural network architecture and updates weights each epoch, so learning/training can be continued at will
Repeats same action a specified number of times
Updates the network at a specified interval
